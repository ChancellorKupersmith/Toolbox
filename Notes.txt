Toolbox (Dev Web App)
Why it's cool?
Developed productivity application for developers to promote good practices in code focusing on improving code reusability, testing, documentation
Dashboard for data usage promoting modular design for written programs
Allows developers to have their own hall of fame of code that theyâ€™re most proud of.
Show off relatable depth of knowledge try to include metrics for algos

    I wanted the user to be able to reminise about past code they've written like going through an old tool box, nastelgic and useful.
    Nastelgic:
        Hall of fame:
            - need user easy way of ranking (if possible tracking) code
    Useful:
        Portable:
            Cloud storage: Free version of cloud providers, do the math to figure out costs
    
Features:
    1. Code text storage
    2. Code Retrieval
    3. Data Analytics
    4. Rating system (Hall of Fame)
    5. Test Code storage
    7. Test Code Coverage
    8. Code Notes

    Idea networking aspect where users can share code snippets.

    Custom Animations and Search result views for results less than a certain amount.
    condintionaly render search results instead of pinboard if recieving results
    dynamically render filter modules into filter bar based on screen size
    Add infinite scroll logic to search results
